                    <p>Funded by EU Horizon 2020, the ChronoPilot project explores an interesting topic about time
                        perception in VR/AR and how we can modulate it for good use. In collaboration with researchers
                        from several other universities, we develop various prototypes serving as the platform for
                        scientific investigation on time perception in VR/AR.</p>

                    <p>DELICIOS was a 4-year international collaborative project to which my PhD research contributes
                        and belongs. My work involved a series of experiments to reveal the rationale and psychology
                        behind people's decisions on delegating critical tasks to embodied AI. The results were further
                        developed into a theory offering insights in human-AI trust and collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Nominated as the best Bachelor project of the year. An application was developed that stitches
                        individual images into a spherical panorama for VR. Built upon OpenCV, the application extracts
                        SIFT feature points to match and and properly register the different images onto a sphere.
                        Further measures were taken to balance the color and exposure of the panorama.</p>
